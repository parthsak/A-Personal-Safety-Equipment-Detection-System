# A-Personal-Safety-Equipment-Detection-System
to build a vision-based safety equipment detection system, which can be implemented for real time purposes.  

## Dataset:
* Data with Annotations: 4,750
* Data without Annotations (Test): 250

## Results
Sample Helmet and Head detection results

Head detection - Here we can find that as in the dataset there are less head data as compared to helmet sets, so the model is not that good enough in finding heads in most of the images. For this single person image head detection though is good.
